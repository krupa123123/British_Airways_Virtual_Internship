# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship
My work during a virtual internship with British Airways, and it is consisted of two tasks. 

# First Task
The first task was focused on data analysis and visualization, where I reviewed and visualized data to gain insights.

# Second Task
The second task was about feature engineering, where I transformed and selected features to improve the model performance, and building predictive models to make predictions based on the data.
